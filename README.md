# How to use this repository?
## Prerequisites - set your environment and IDE
To begin, let's assume you don't have any working environment but only a Linux machine. Follow the steps to prepare your machine, start with installing newer versions of the existing packages on the machine:<br>
```$ sudo apt-get upgrade```

* Check if there is Java on your machine by running the command ```$ java --version```; if not, install the latest package of Java:
```$ sudo apt-get install default-jre```.
* Run the command ```$ java --version``` that should return the latest version.
* Next, install the latest JDK (javac):
``$ sudo apt-get install default-jdk``.<br>
* Verify the Java development kit was installed properly by running the command ``$ javas --version``, it should return the latest version.

Lastly, install an IDE. I chose to use IntelliJ IDEA, but feel free to choose any other IDE [here is a comparison][1]. Follow the instructions in this guide to [install IntelliJ IDEA on Ubuntu][2]
